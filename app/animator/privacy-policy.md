# Privacy Policy

Protecting the privacy and data belonging to our clients and users of our apps and sites is important to Pixodesk LIMITED. 
This Privacy Policy describes how we use and protect any information or data files you provide to us.


The Pixodesk Animator application does not collect any personal data.

The application can access documents from your hard drive only if you explicitly give it a permission, for instance, by using a file dialog, by dragging documents to the application window or by opening documents in Finder.

Apple may collect crash report data so that we can see it, but only if you choose to submit it. 
All crash reports are anonymous and they are used to improve application functionality.


### PAYMENTS

This data includes logs and error reports, and is never sent automatically to us. As part of a software support incident, we may ask you to send some of this diagnostic data to us, and this is entirely optional. Anything you do send will be retained securely and confidentially, only for the duration of the support ticket, then deleted, and never shared with 3rd parties.
