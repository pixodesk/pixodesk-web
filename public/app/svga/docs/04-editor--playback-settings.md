# Set default playback settings & triggers

[← The editor](./03-editor--editor.md) · [Contents](./README.md) · Next: [Installing the players (overview) →](./05-player--installation.md)

Set *how long*, *how many times* and *what starts it* once, in the editor, and forget about
it: the settings travel inside the file, every player reads them, and the animation plays
correctly with no configuration on the page.

This page is the **editor** side: which control writes which value. To change any of it at
runtime, from component props or the player API, see
[Playback settings & triggers](./10-player--playback-and-triggers.md).

Open the panel by clicking empty canvas so that **nothing is selected** — these are the
document's settings, not an element's. Everything here is written into the document's
`animator` block on save.

## Timing

| Control | Writes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Duration** | `duration` (ms) | the length of **one** iteration; keyframe times are offsets within it |
| **Delay** | `delay` (ms) | wait before the first iteration starts |
| **Iterations** | `iterations` | a number, or *infinite* |
| **Direction** | `direction` | *normal*, *reverse*, *alternate* (ping-pong), *alternate-reverse* |
| **Fill mode** | `fill` | what shows outside the active time — *forwards* holds the last frame, *backwards* shows the first frame during the delay, *both*, or *none* to revert to the static SVG |
| **Reset on finish** | `resetOnFinish` | snap back to the start after a natural finish |
| **Frame rate** | `frameRate` | a target rate for the frame-loop engine only; leave it unset to run uncapped |

## Engine mode

**Engine mode** writes `mode`, and decides what actually drives the animation in a browser:

- **Auto** (default) — the Web Animations API, falling back to a frame loop by itself when the
  document animates something WAAPI cannot express.
- **WAAPI** — Web Animations API only.
- **Frames** — a `requestAnimationFrame` loop; universal browser support, honours *frame rate*.

Leave it on **auto** unless you need a guarantee. React Native ignores it — playback there is
always native-driven.

## Start trigger

**Start** writes `trigger.startOn` — what makes the animation begin:

| Editor label | Writes | Begins when |
|---|---|---|
| On load | `load` | the animation is displayed (default) |
| When visible | `scrollIntoView` | it scrolls into view; the **threshold** writes `scrollIntoViewThreshold` (0–1) |
| On mouse over | `mouseOver` | the pointer enters it |
| On click | `click` | it is clicked |
| Manually from JS | `programmatic` | never on its own — code calls `play()` |

**When the trigger ends** (pointer leaves, scrolled out of view, a second click) writes
`trigger.outAction`: *continue*, *pause*, *reset* or *reverse*.

**Use JS Triggers** decides how a pre-rendered *SVG + CSS* export implements the trigger. Off,
the file is pure CSS: *On load* plays immediately and *On mouse over* works through CSS
`:hover` — but *On click* and *When visible* have no CSS equivalent and **fall back to On
load**. On, the export gains a few lines of inline script (no library) and every trigger, out
action and *Reset on finish* work as set. The JSON format and the *SVG + JS animation* export
always honour the full setting.

## Timeline — clock or scroll

**Timeline** chooses what the playhead follows:

- **Time** (default) — the clock. The animation plays on its own once triggered.
- **Scroll** — the page's scroll position drives the playhead directly, with pinning and range
  options. Scroll all the way back and the animation rewinds with you.

## Which formats keep these settings

| Export | What survives |
|---|---|
| **Pixodesk JSON** | everything on this page |
| **SVG + CSS animation** | timing; *On load*, and *On mouse over* via CSS `:hover`. *On click* / *When visible* fall back to *On load*; *Reset on finish* is not applied |
| **SVG + CSS + JS triggers** | timing, every trigger, the out action and *Reset on finish* — through a few inline lines of script, no library |
| **SVG + JS animation** | everything, including engine mode |
